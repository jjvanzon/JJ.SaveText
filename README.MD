# JJ.SaveText

*Jan-Joost van Zon, 2018-12-02*

The *SaveText prototype app* is an experiment in which I proved and refined my favorite software design patterns.
The idea was to make things compatible with many different platforms. It can run on:

* Databases
* XML files
* Mobile
* iOS
* Android
* Windows Phone

The folder structure is representative of the main layering:

* Data
* Business
* Presentation

Other folders:

* Database: SaveText prototype app's database initialization and migration
* Demos: Arbitrary demo code
