I really feel the quality of this framework should have been improved before publishing. I only publish it now for legal reasons. So fellow programmers: I apologize.

I started programming this framework at home in 2013. I also use a variation on it at work in a team of 7 that I lead. In this framework we put any reusable code we make, that is not related to a particular business domain. We do not often encounter bugs, but if we do, we just fix them. And if we are missing something, we just extend it. We keep it incomplete, so our application development does not get slowed down and we can just get on with it.

In the documentation I describe a way of working and design patterns I use at home and in our team at work.
