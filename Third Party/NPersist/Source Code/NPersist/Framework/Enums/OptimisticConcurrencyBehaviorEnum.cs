//Note: Perhaps we should add IncludeAlways for forcing the load of unloaded properties. On the other hand, they would be loaded just before
//the update takes place, probably within a transaction, and it wouldn't help much. Maybe even giving false sense of security.
//...Maybe a MustBeLoaded setting that throws an exception if an important property wasan't loaded during commit ?
