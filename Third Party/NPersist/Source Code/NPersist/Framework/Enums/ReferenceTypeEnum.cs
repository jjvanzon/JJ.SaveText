    /// For example, with a relationship between orders and orderlines, the Order.OrderLines list property would be considered in NPersist to be 
    /// marked as "ManyToOne" since the left part of the relationship name (the "Many" in "ManyToOne") refers to the property in question. Conversely,
    /// the OrderLine.Order reference property is considered "OneToMany". NHibernate uses the right part of the relationship name to describe the
