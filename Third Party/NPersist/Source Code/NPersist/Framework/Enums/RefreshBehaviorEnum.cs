    /// an NPath query that brings up some employees and then issue another NPath query (via the same context/cache) bringing up some of the 
    /// same employees again, you have a refresh situation. When the first query was issued, the employees were filled with the values from the
    /// database. During the second query, the data for the same employees is brought from the database once more, meaning we could update the 
    /// cached employees and fill them with the most recent values from the database. Sometimes this is desirable, at other times it isn't.

    /// case we usually don't want to loose our unsaved changes by having them automatically overwritten with the fresh database values.
