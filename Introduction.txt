JJ is a new code base.

The previous code base (Circle) was started 3 years ago.

My ideas about architecture have changed, but I will not refactor the old code base right now.

The old code base is too specific to certain functionality and certain ways of programming.
The new architecture is going to be more agnostic about specific data models, specific programming models, specific API's and specific functionality.
The first order grouping will be by aspects such as apps, services, framework, services, validation, security, etcetera,
unlike the old code base which already reflected specific functionality and a specific way of working quite high up the hierarchy of the namespacing.

The older code base is not a way of working that is portable between what I do at home and what I do at the office.
This was because work at home was experimental ground, which should be allowed to diverge from however you would do things at work.

However, I feel that an architecture should accommodate many types of programming in an orderly fashion.
Any type of programming should fit better into the new architecture.
Except ofcourse that it will be first and foremost be based on .NET, Visual Studio and mostly C#.


Time to go back to the drawing board.
I will not work on the functionality of the old code base for a while,
but I will do some programming in service of my home studies.
