JJ is the new code base.
The previous code was started 3 years ago.

My ideas about architecture have changed.

The old code base is about a specific way of programming, not like mainstream .NET development.
The way of working is not portable between what I do at home and what I do at the office.

The new architecture is more agnostic about specific data models, specific programming models, specific API's and specific functionality.
The first order grouping will be by aspects such as apps, services, framework, services, validation, security, etcetera,
unlike the old code base which basically had a first-order grouping by functionality.

I feel that one architecture should accommodate many types of programming and many types of functionality in an orderly fashion.
