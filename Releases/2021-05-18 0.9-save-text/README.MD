JJ.SaveText Release 0.9
=======================

*2021-05-18*

Introduction
------------

The *SaveText prototype app* was an experiment to test certain software programming techniques.

The intent of the project might be described [here](https://github.com/jjvanzon/JJ.SaveText).


Installation Files
------------------

These might be the setup & deployment files that were produced. They may include:

- Database
- Web site (MVC)
- App service ('cloud' web service)
- Windows applications
- Mobile apps

Suggestions about how to install might be found in the README.


Database
--------

- "SaveTextDB.0.9.zip" might contain a database backup.
- The file might be unzipped and restored in SQL Server with name PROD_SaveTextDB.
- The database user name "prod" may be expected with password "prod".


Web Site
--------

- "JJ.Presentation.SaveText.Mvc.0.9.zip" may contain web site files.
- This may be a 'web site' variation on SaveText.
- It is suggested to unzip it to a folder.
- And to create an IIS web site that uses that folder as its *physical path*.

App Service
-----------

- "JJ.Presentation.SaveText.AppService.0.9.zip" may contain files for something that is like a 'cloud' web service, to which some of the apps might connect.
- It is suggested to unzip it to a folder.
- And to create an IIS web site that uses that folder as its *physical path*.
 

Windows Applications
--------------------

- The following files might contain Windows applications:
    - "JJ.Presentation.SaveText.WinForms.Offline.0.9.zip"
    - "JJ.Presentation.SaveText.WinForms.OfflineWithSync.0.9.zip"
    - "JJ.Presentation.SaveText.WinForms.Online.0.9.zip"
    - "JJ.Presentation.SaveText.WinForms.Online.CustomSoapClient.0.9.zip"
    - "JJ.Presentation.SaveText.WinForms.OnlineOfflineSwitched.0.9.zip"
- They may have no installers.
- They might be unzipped and put somewhere on a computer and then perhaps shortcuts made to them.


Mobile Apps
-----------

- The following files may contain mobile app files needed for deployment:
    - "JJ.Presentation.SaveText.Unity.Offline.Android.0.9.zip"
    - "JJ.Presentation.SaveText.Unity.Offline.iOS.0.9.zip"
    - "JJ.Presentation.SaveText.Unity.Offline.WindowsPhone.0.9.7z"
    - "JJ.Presentation.SaveText.Unity.OfflineWithSync.Android.0.9.zip"
    - "JJ.Presentation.SaveText.Unity.Online.Android.0.9.zip"
- (Note the Windows Phone one is a 7z (7-zip) file not zip. The zip file appeared to be a bit too big.)
- They may not be compatible anymore with newer mobile devices.
- The precise way these deployment files are to be used might not be described here. Here is an impression of it. But perhaps do not expect much from this.
- The Android variations might have been installed once by copying it to the right location on an Android phone.
- The iOS variation may have required an Apple Mac running XCode and a paid developer subscription with Apple.
- The WindowsPhone variation might have been deployed using a version of Visual Studio (2012?) specifically tailored for Windows Phone.
