# JJ.Framework.Conversion

Makes it easier to convert simple types.

* `SimpleTypeConverter.ParseValue`: One method to parse numeric types, their signed and unsigned variations, DateTime, TimeSpan, Guid and Enum types, IntPtr, UIntPtr and their nullable variations. Those often require different types of conversions. This method just takes care of it.
* `SimpleTypeConverter.ConvertValue`: Makes it easier to convert nullables along with non-nullables.
* `DecimalParser`, `DoubleParser`, `Int16Parser`, `Int32Parser`, `Int64Parser`, `SingleParser`: Making it easier to parse nullables, for instance.
* `EnumParser`: Make it a little easier to use enum parsing.
