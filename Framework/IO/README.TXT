JJ.Framework.IO is a place to put code for working with different basic file format and streams.

Currently it only contains a class for reading out CSV files and a StreamHelper, which converts between string, Stream and byte[]. Surprizingly different code is required for converting between those three, and this helper class makes it a bit more consistent. BinaryWriterExtensions contains some methods for reading and writing structs to a stream.
