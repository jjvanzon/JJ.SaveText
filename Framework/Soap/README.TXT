JJ.Framework.Soap contains an almost complete implementation of the SOAP protocol. At least, the client-side of it. One of the things missing is byte arrays, and a few other things I cannot recall right now. Certain mobile platforms do not support native .NET implementations such as System.ServiceModel or System.Web.Services. That is why I wrote this alternative implementation. When you do not tweak any options, it will behave the same as a SOAP-based WCF client. In fact, it has a CustomWcfSoapClient class which is a replacement for System.ServiceModel.ClientBase<TChannel>, but only for the SOAP protocol.

One thing is a little awkward about the SoapClient class: you can pass a delegate to actually send a pre-formatted SOAP message. If you do not pass the delegate to the constructor, SoapClient will send it using an HttpWebRequest object. In one of my multi-platform experiments, the HttpWebRequest was not even supported, so I had to inject a delegate that would take care of actually HTTP'ing the message for me. The mobile platforms were really riding me that day.
